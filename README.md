### 🚀 Daily JavaScript App - 15: Dark Theme

This repository is part of my daily coding challenge to build a JavaScript application every day. 🌟 The goal is to sharpen my JavaScript skills 🧠 and develop the habit of consistent coding. 💻✨

## 🌟 Dark Theme Project

This project contains a simple script for toggling between light and dark themes on a website. The toggle functionality is implemented with JavaScript, and the theme icon changes dynamically based on the active theme.

---

### 🛠 How It Works

1. **Theme Switching**:  
   - When the user clicks on the theme icon, the `dark-theme` class is toggled on the `<body>` element.

2. **Dynamic Icon Update**:  
   - If the `dark-theme` class is applied, the theme icon switches to a **sun** (`sun.png`).  
   - If the `dark-theme` class is removed, the theme icon switches to a **moon** (`moon.png`).
